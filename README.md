## The team
We were a mix of people with different skills.
- **Designers** - Bíbí & Ása (with creative input from Arna Vala)
- **Coders** - Arna Vala , Heba & Tristan
<br><br>
 
## Project Management
We used Agile project management methods
- Had status meetings every day
- Used Slack for communication
- Asana for managing tasks
<br><br>

## Design Sprint
We started the project with a 5 day design sprint which helped a lot to understand what we wanted to portray.  
As we worked through the week the focus of the project shifted further and futher away from our initial idea of having a clothing based weather application.  
In the end we thought it would not give the user enough value.  
Our focus shifted over to getting people prepared for the ever changing weather, by teaching them how Icelanders follow the weather, as well as helping them find activities accordingly.
